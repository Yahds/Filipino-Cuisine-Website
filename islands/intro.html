                <p>Filipino cuisine is a reflection of the influences from the country’s History of colonization, trade and migration. While the cuisine is in a constant state of growing and changing, the Filipino culture and cooking techniques are still evident in each dish. The global popularity of Filipino cuisine is steadily rising. For instance, famous YouTubers such as The Sunbae Club and People Vs Food have introduced Filipino food to their own people in their country.</p>
                <p>In a 2018 study conducted by YouGov involving 25,000 people across 24 countries including the Philippines, Thailand, Australia and among others.This study was conducted to learn and gain insights about the food preferences of these countries. According to the results, 67 percent of the Filipinos favored and were open-minded about any cuisine from other countries. Unfortunately, other countries were not the same with the Filipino Cuisine, as the survey results showed that it was under-appreciated by the other countries. Thus, this website serves as a platform to introduce and encourage other individuals from various nationalities,including those within the Philippines, to try out our food and gain knowledge on the newest trends.</p>
