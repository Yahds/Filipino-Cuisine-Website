        <h4 id = "intro">
            <br>
            The Visayas region of the Philippines is a culinary wonderland, where flavors and traditions meld to create a truly 
            unforgettable food experience. From the bustling seafood markets of Roxas City to the aromatic inasal grills of Negros, 
            Visayan cuisine reflects a rich tapestry of influences.
            <br><br>
            Visayan food is more than just a feast for the senses; it's a journey into the region's history and culture. With dishes 
            like Buriring pushing culinary boundaries and sweet treats like Piaya enticing your taste buds, Visayan cuisine draws 
            inspiration from various sources while staying rooted in its indigenous cooking techniques.
            <br><br>
            As you explore the flavors of the Visayas, you'll uncover a cuisine shaped by centuries of trade, colonization, and local 
            innovation. And when your culinary adventure concludes, don't forget to bring home local products and pasalubong, so you 
            can share the tastes and memories of the Visayas with your loved ones.<br><br></h4>

            <br>
            <p>Another delicacy from Visayas is the popular braised pork dish Humba, whose name directly translates to tender pork.

            While similar to adobo, which uses ingredients such as soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, onions, peppercorns, and laurel, 
            Humba differentiates itself with the addition of pineapple juice and or sugar.
                
            It has since evolved to more closely resemble adobo; however, restricts itself to only using pork as its main meat 
            component.<br><br></p>

            <br>    
            <p>A literal “to die for” dish, buriring is a species of puffer fish found in Negros during the months of July and August.
            Often found in multitudes during these months, these puffer fish strangely lose their toxicity and have since gained 
            popularity in the region as a native delicacy. 
                
            However, every catch has to be inspected carefully, because there is a poisonous variety of the pufferfish that can 
            also be found in the area. <br><br></p>

            <br>
            <p>When people think of what pasalubong to bring home, piaya often comes to mind. This popular delicacy that originates from 
            Negros is a flaky unleavened bread filled with sweet muscovado sugar.
                
            To make it, one only needs 5 ingredients: cold butter, flour, ice water, salt, and muscovado sugar. By combining the cold 
            butter, flour, and ice water, one can easily create a dough that is similar to that of pie and use that to envelop a 
            muscovado sugar filling. <br><br></p>

            <p>Essentially chicharon bulaklak but better, this Cebuano street food is not for the faint of heart. Sold by pungko-pungko 
            (sidewalk vendors) all over Cebu, this finger food is made by chopping up pork intestines and deep-frying them until they 
            are golden brown.

            Similar to chicharon, they are best paired with a spicy vinegar sauce and a cold drink.  <br><br></p>

            <br>
            <p>Also known as the infamous Soup No. 5, lansiao is an aphrodisiac soup made from bull’s testes. A dish inherited from Chinese 
            immigrants, this Cebuano delicacy derived its name from the Hokkien translation of the phrase “male’s genitals.”

            Similar to many Filipino soups, it involves cooking the aforementioned main ingredient in a broth and filling it with aromatics, 
            such as tanglad (lemongrass), onions, garlic, ginger, and more. <br><br></p>

            <p>This popular Illongo dish is a beef soup made of beef shank and bone marrow that is cooked with sour fruits like batuan

            If you’ve never tried kansi, think of it as a cross between sinigang and bulalo, this dish uses a variety of local flavors, 
            such as jackfruit, tanglad (lemongrass), tomatoes, garlic, patis (fish sauce), and atsuete (annatto seeds). <br><br></p>

            <br>
            <p>With a festival to its name, this specialty of Cabatuan is a soup whose name literally means “binalot” or wrapped. To make 
            this dish, locals place wilted banana leaves in a bowl that they then fill with various ingredients, such as native chicken, 
            banana leaves, garlic, onion, tanglad, ginger, tomatoes, and water.
                
            After placing all the ingredients in the bowl, they then tie the banana leaves up to seal everything in a pouch-like container 
            that they then steam in a clay pot. The result is a lightly flavored broth with sumptuous cooked native chicken that many in 
            the region enjoy. <br><br></p>

            Not to be confused with ubod (heart of palm), this dish is a ginataan that traditionally stews chicken with the various

            <p>Leyte takes flavor to the next level with Morón, a suman (rice cake) that is mixed with tablea (native chocolate tablets).

            Served in a banana leaf wrapper, it is popularly eaten with hot coffee or sikwate (hot chocolate).<br><br></p>

            However, while the latter is flavored with bagoong (shrimp paste), this dish relies solely on the flavor of the vegetables
